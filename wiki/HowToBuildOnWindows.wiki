#summary Describes how to build Glint on Windows
#labels Building,Glint,Windows

== Environment ==

Install the following to create the build environment:

 * Subversion (svn client) - [http://subversion.tigris.org/downloads/subversion-1.4.4.zip from here]
 * Visual Studio 2005 (Perhaps other versions will work too)

== Getting the code ==
If you don't have the code yet, here are the steps, from cmd.exe window (assuming c:\projects\glint is the place where you want to keep the code):
{{{
cd /d C:\projects
mkdir glint-ui
svn checkout http://glint-ui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk glint-ui
}}}

== Building ==

Now you can just build it (assuming the directory structure above):
{{{
cd /d C:\projects\glint-ui\glint
make
}}}
The result is going to be in bin-dbg/win-i386

To build non-debug bits, use this:
{{{
make MODE=opt
}}}
The result is going to be in bin-opt/win-i386
